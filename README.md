**Execution**

You can execute this .jar file from the command line. Move into the directory and run <./bubbleChallenge.jar>. If you don't see bubbles appearing. stop the program with ctrl+c and run the previous command again.

On MacOS, the file is also runnable by double clicking the .jar file. However, on Linux it appears that you must use the command line.
